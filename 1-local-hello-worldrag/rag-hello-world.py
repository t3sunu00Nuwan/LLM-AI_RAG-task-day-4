# --- RETRIEVAL (the "R" in RAG) ---
# NearestNeighbors is a k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) search algorithm from scikit-learn.
# It builds an in-memory index over embedding vectors so we can quickly find the
# documents whose embeddings are closest (most similar) to a query embedding.
# We use it here as a simple vector store / retrieval engine.
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# NumPy provides efficient n-dimensional array operations.
# Used here to convert embedding tensors into plain NumPy arrays that
# NearestNeighbors can consume (it expects array-like input).
import numpy as np

# --- EMBEDDING MODEL ---
# SentenceTransformer (from the `sentence-transformers` library) wraps a
# transformer model to produce vector representations/embeddings for sentences/paragraphs.
# Calling model.encode(texts) returns one embedding vector per text.
# These embeddings capture semantic meaning, so texts with similar meaning
# end up close together in vector space — which is what makes retrieval work.
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# --- GENERATION ---
#  Huggingface provided AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM loads a sequence-to-sequence language 
#   model (e.g. T5, FLAN-T5).
#   Seq2Seq models take an input sequence (our prompt with context + question) and
#   produce an output sequence (the answer). This is different from causal/decoder-only
#   models (like GPT) which only predict the next token in a single sequence.
#   FLAN-T5 was instruction-tuned, making it good at following prompts like
#   "Answer with facts from the context."
#
# AutoTokenizer loads the matching tokenizer for the model.
#   A tokenizer converts raw text into token IDs (integers) that the model understands,
#   and converts token IDs back into human-readable text. Every model has its own
#   vocabulary, so the tokenizer must match the model.
